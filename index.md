# SAP Modernization Lab

## Goal

In this lab, you will learn how ServiceNow Creator Workflows can help you to modernize ERP processes with the tools and functionalities available on the ServiceNow platform. Be prepared, there are no-code elements, as well as some basic scripting requirements in this lab, but not to worry, I'll be here to guide you through the process!

You'll learn how the platform can be a catch-all for everything above SAP as a system of engagement; the fuel for ERP modernization.

## Background

A business process is a set of activities that have to be performed to complete an end-to-end business scenario. There are multiple ERP business processes, the most common ones are listed below:

Name | What is it?
------------ | -------------
Order to Cash | Order to cash (OTC or O2C) is a set of business processes that involve receiving and fulfilling customer requests
Procure to Pay | Procure to pay (PTP or P2P) is the process of requisitioning, purchasing, receiving, paying for, and accounting for goods and services, covering the entire process from point of order right through to payment.
Hire to Retire | Hire to retire (H2R) is a human resources process that includes everything that needs to be done over the course of an employee's career with a company.
Plan to Produce | Plan-to-Produce (Pl2P) encompasses an end-to-end perspective on producing goods. It depicts the shop-floor procedures and focuses on the integration of surrounding aspects into production processes.
Plan to Inventory | Plan to Inventory (P2I) the process of determining the optimal quantity and timing of inventory for the purpose of aligning it with sales and production capacity.
Quote to Cash | Quote-to-cash (QTC) process encompasses many sales, account management, order fulfillment, billing, and accounts receivables functions.
Record to Report | Record to report (R2R) is a finance and accounting management process that involves collecting, processing and presenting accurate financial data.

Often times, there are multiple exceptions outside of an expected business process flow (sometimes refered to as a "Happy Flow") that organizations need to account for - either by customizing the ERP Software, or relying on manual processes that sit outside it. 

Then, there is also the issue of data availability. There is a learning curve to navigating ERP systems due to the complexity of the business objects. Everyday business users might not have access to the right environment and training to use these ERP systems. There needs to be a friendlier way to interact with the data.

ServiceNow Creator Workflows solves these challenges with it's low code capabilities paired with easy to configure integrations into ERP systems. We will focus on SAP in this lab.
